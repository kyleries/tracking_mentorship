Samples of this code, particularly the annotated files were completed as part of a Rails mentoring project. I assisted another developer with a complex nested form involving several models and a custom jQuery/Helper solution to complete the project.

This code demonstrates a strong understanding of the internals of ActiveRecord models and associations, as well as proper use of the View to manage multiple dynamically generated objects.
